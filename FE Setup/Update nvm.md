**Update nvm:**

To update `nvm` (Node Version Manager), you can follow these steps:

1. **Update `nvm` Using the Install Script:**
    
    Run the following command to fetch the latest version and update `nvm`:
    
    ```bash
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash
    ```
    
    Note: Replace `v0.39.5` with the latest version tag from the [nvm releases page](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/releases) if there's a newer version available.
    
2. **Reinitialize `nvm` in Your Current Terminal Session:**
    
    After running the install script, you need to reload your terminal configuration to apply the updates. You can do this by running:
    
    ```bash
    export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
    ```
    
3. **Verify the Update:**
    
    Check if `nvm` has been updated by running:
    
    ```bash
    nvm --version
    ```
    
    This should show the updated version of `nvm`.
    
4. **Restart Your Terminal:**
    
    Sometimes, closing and reopening your terminal is necessary to apply all changes.
    

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully update `nvm` to the latest version.
